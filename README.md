### Hello!

Name's Gabi, everyone calls me Crow or Star

I've been coding small scale projects for a while now, and am very much eager to learn more,

I like making other people smile, even if I don't think I'm very qualified to do so!

I always try to be honest about the things I say, even if it hurts,
so I would appreciate if you could be honest back! I just wanna learn what I can do right!
